   install all the packages needed.
3. Go into the newly created virtual environment in step (4) by typing `$ pipenv shell`.
4. In this environment, you could develop run the environment, train models etc by running
   notebooks (`$ jupyter lab`).

***B. Managing Dependencies using Anaconda Python***

1. Install Anaconda Python (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. In the cloned Github repo, run `$ conda env create --file environment.yml` to create a new
   virtual environment and install all the packages needed.
3. Go into the newly created virtual environment in step (4) by typing `$ conda activate pyBasket`
   .
4. In this environment, you could develop run the environment, train models etc by running
   notebooks (`$ jupyter lab`).

## Examples

Example notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/pyBasket/tree/main/notebooks).
This includes a demonstration of the environment, as well as other notebooks to train models and
evaluate the results.
